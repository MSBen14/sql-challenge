## Background

This repository discusses a research project on the human resources data base at Pewlett Hackard company from 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project,  tables are deisgned to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## 1. Data Modeling

To model the employee data a basic data modleing technique called Entity-Relationship-Diagrams or ERD was used. By using this technique six employee tables are identified, this entities are employees, departments, salaries, titles, department managers, and department employees. 
The ERD also looks as follows:

## 2. Data Engineering

By usnig the availabe information a table schema for each of the six CSV files was created, and the data types, primary keys, foreign keys and constraints also developped. The order of the tables is based on the primary and foreign arrangments.

> Note: to import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table the order strictly should be followed to avoid errors.

## 2. Data Analysis

1.List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2.List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3.List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4.List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5.List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6.List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7.List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8.List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
